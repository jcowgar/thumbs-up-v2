# zmk-config

This is my ZMK configuration for a [ThumbsUp!](https://www.thumbsup.shop/)
[v2](https://www.thumbsup.shop/product-page/thumbs-up-v2-nice-nano-wireless-bluetooth-zmk)
keyboard.

At the core is the Colemak DH keyboard layout, a cursor, number and symbol
layer, as well as a few simple key bindings/macros for using Sublime Text.

This does demo ZMK features including keymaps, layers, complex keys, macros and
combos.
